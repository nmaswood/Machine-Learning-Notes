    "\n",
    "Consider a regression problem where we are not exactly sure of the order of polynomial required to fit the data. We are struggling between overfitting and underfitting. One method to overcome this problem is use locally weighted linear regression. This method essentially produces a line of best fit in a local regression around $x_i$\n",
